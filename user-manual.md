# User Manual

## Introduction
I do not remember where I heard about this idea of a personal user manual, but I love it. None of us are mind readers, so let's remove ambiguity and improve communication through clarity.

I broke mine into two sections. The first section is my Manager Manual, and the second focuses on my style and preferences as an Individual Contributor.

## As a Manager

### How I View Success

* **Self-Accountability.** I think this is _the_ key metric of success. Accountability in all things: your career, professional development, personal life, etc. You define your version of success for any of the things you do, and hold yourself accountable for getting them done.

* **Continuous Improvement.** Always look for opportunities to learn and improve, no matter how small. Continuous incremental progress leads to substantial long-term results. This includes improving at work and at life. Almost everything can be improved.

* **Growth Mindset.** I am a firm believer in Dweck's "growth mindset", that is, any one can do anything given time, effort and determination. Of course it is not easy, but it is possible.

* **Collaboration.** You cannot do everything. I this is a mistake I often make. Make sure to effectively collaborate with your team to achieve shared goals.

* **Impact Focused.** Prioritizing activities and projects that clearly drive meaningful impact and tangible results. Avoid hypotheticals until it works.


### How I Communicate
* **Clear, Open, and Honest.** This is a key value of mine. I aim to give you direct, constructive, and actionable communication, free from ambiguity. I will actively communicate changes, updates, and decisions as promptly as I can to help prevent misunderstandings.

* **Weekly 1:1s.** I learned this from my favorite previous manager. A short weekly checkpoint for direct reports ensures nothing has time to fester. This 1:1 is for you, and so we will review things in your checklist before we get to my checklist. If there is nothing on the agenda for that week, we cancel the meeting.

* **Asynchronously.** I value written communication (email, Slack, shared docs) to respect everyone's time and give thoughtful responses. Expect detailed context in asynchronous communication. Meetings are important, and we will have them, but only when they are required.

* **Active Listening.** I strive to genuinely understand your perspective and will actively solicit your input during discussions. That means I am going to ask you what you think in a meeting.

#### Giving and Receiving Feedback
Feedback is a gift, but it can be hard to give when the news is bad. I strive to provide feedback that is timely, specific, and constructive, and I expect the same from you. Receiving feedback openly and with gratitude helps both of us grow.

* **Balanced Feedback.** Providing positive recognition alongside constructive criticism to ensure feedback is holistic and actionable. It is just as important to know what is going well as what is not.

* **Frequent Check-ins.** Regular conversations around performance and growth help normalize feedback exchanges. This is a big reason we have a weekly 1:1, but occasionally, they will be informal and on the spot. I do my best to avoid the dreaded "Hey, can we talk real quick" message, but I believe quick small corrections are better than big intervention.

### Things I Do That May Annoy You or Be Misunderstood

* **High Level Handoffs.** I do not give extensive details. I prefer to set "clear" objectives and trust you to determine the best path forward. (sometimes objectives are not as clear as the could be)

* **Directness.** My comments can sometimes come across as overly direct. It's intended constructively and never personally. I feel like this is the best way I can be as professional as possible.

* **Delegation Style.** I may appear hands-off, which can feel like disinterest. It is actually an expression of trust in your abilities. If I have questions on what you are doing, I will go look it up, then come to you with specifics. For example, maybe I disagree with your approach to solving a problem, and you wrote docs on why you think it _is_ the right approach; I am not going to interrupt your flow to tell you I disagree. I can wait for the 1:1.

### What Gains and Loses My Trust

#### Gains my Trust

* **Transparency.** Be honest about your progress, challenges, mistakes, errors. Transparency creates trust.

* **Reliability.** Consistently delivering on promises and proactively communicating potential delays.

* **Integrity.** Acting consistently with strong ethical standards and openly acknowledging errors. If you disagree with something, I expect you to speak up.

* **Initiative.** Taking proactive steps to address issues or seize opportunities without being prompted.

#### Loses my Trust

* **Over Promise and Under Deliver.** Setting unrealistic expectations damages credibility and trust.

* **Consistent Tardiness.** I am not talking about 30 seconds late because you are meeting hopping. Late starts at 3 minutes. Your calendar belongs to youâ€”manage it effectively.

* **Lack of Follow-Through.** Failing to close loops or meet commitments without communication erodes reliability.

### My Growth Areas
* **Budgets and Financial Planning.** This is an area I'm continuously working to improve.

* **Delegation.** I like to be in the driver seat. Finding the right balance between delegating enough is something I'm actively working on. Rest assured, when I delegate, I let go and do not micromanage.

* **Patience in Decisions.** In my mind, so few things are "1 way decisions". Becoming more patient with slower processes or decisions is an ongoing personal development area.

### My Expectations for My Direct Reports

* **Visual Contributions.** No matter the role, you will be contributing in a way that can be seen: committing code, creating docs, taking active notes, giving presentations, sending emails. Clearly show your work and contributions, and make it easy for any one to see your impact.

* **Proactive Communication.** Reach out proactively with updates, blockers, or questions before they become issues.

* **Ownership.** Take full ownership of your tasks and outcomes, actively managing your workload and timelines.

* **Point out Inefficiencies.** No process is sacred. If you followed a playbook and found places for improvement, make the improvements or document them so they are not forgotten

* **Curiosity and Learning.** Continuously seek opportunities to expand your knowledge and skills relevant to your role.

## As an Individual Contributor

### My Work Style
* **Autonomous and Self-Directed.** I thrive when given clear objectives but the autonomy to determine my approach and execution.

* **Organized and Methodical.** I prefer a structured, iterative approach. I typically start with outlines and add then add content.

* **Result-Focused.** I measure my success by the outcomes and results I deliver, rather than activity alone.


### How I Work Best

* **Clear Expectations.** Understanding exactly what is expected of me helps me focus my energy effectively. Of course things will evolve over time.

* **Quiet and Focused Environment.** Minimal interruptions and distractions allow me to produce my best work. Expect me to set a Slack status of "heads-down" and not accept a meeting that was not scheduled a few hours in advance.

* **Collaborative Alignment.** Regularly aligning with my team ensures I stay in sync with group objectives. I love a good daily standup.

* **Structured Deadlines.** Having clear and realistic deadlines helps me prioritize tasks efficiently.

### My Strengths


### What I need to Stay Motivated

* **Meaningful Work.** Knowing my efforts contribute to _real_ larger goals. I understand some busy work is required, but I will not do well with "because I said so" logic.

* **Professional Development.** Opportunities to learn and grow professionally. This can be in the work that I do, or time and space to do it myself.

* **Balance and Flexibility.** Flexibility to manage workload sustainably.

### How to Help Me Do My Best Work

* **Do Your Homework.** This means a couple of things. First, there will be ample evidence of what what I am doing and it's progress. If you ask me "what are you working on" without looking at the Board, I will be grumpy with you. If you need help on a task, but have not attempted anything and ask me "how do I do this thing", I will be grumpy with you.

* **Provide Context.** Sharing the rationale behind tasks boosts my effectiveness.

* **Constructive Feedback.** Regular, actionable feedback guides my improvement.

Clear Priorities. Helping me understand what is urgent versus important.

Resources and Support. Ensuring I have necessary resources and support to succeed.

### What I Need From Managers
Trust and Autonomy. Trust in my abilities with room to independently manage tasks.

Open Channels. Maintain open communication for questions or concerns.

Clarity. Clear instructions and goals to avoid confusion or misalignment.

Advocacy. Support and advocate for my work and professional growth opportunities.
